# AWS Setup Guide with S3 Bucket, CloudTrail, and CloudWatch

## Step 1: Setting Up S3 Bucket for CloudTrail Logs

### 1.1 Create an S3 Bucket
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [S3 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/).
2. Click on **Create bucket**.
3. Enter a unique name for your bucket (e.g., `my-cloudtrail-logs-bucket`).
4. Choose the region for your bucket (typically the same region as your CloudTrail trails for latency reasons).
5. Click **Create**.

### 1.2 Configure Bucket Policy for CloudTrail Logs
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AWSCloudTrailAclCheck",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "cloudtrail.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "s3:GetBucketAcl",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-cloudtrail-logs-bucket"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AWSCloudTrailWrite",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Service": "cloudtrail.amazonaws.com"
            },
            "Action": "s3:PutObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-cloudtrail-logs-bucket/AWSLogs/<YourAccountID>/*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "s3:x-amz-acl": "bucket-owner-full-control"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
- Replace `my-cloudtrail-logs-bucket` with your actual bucket name.
- Replace `<YourAccountID>` with your AWS account ID.

### 1.3 Enable Logging in AWS CloudTrail
1. Open the [CloudTrail console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail).
2. Choose the trail for which you want to enable logging or create a new trail.
3. In the **Storage location** section, choose **Configure**.
4. Select **Existing S3 bucket** and choose the bucket you created (`my-cloudtrail-logs-bucket`).
5. Click **Save**.

## Step 2: Setting Up CloudWatch Logs for CloudTrail

### 2.1 Create a CloudWatch Log Group
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [CloudWatch console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).
2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Logs**, then choose **Log groups**.
3. Choose **Create log group** and enter a name for the log group (e.g., `CloudTrail/LogGroup`).

### 2.2 Create an IAM Role for CloudTrail
1. Open the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).
2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Roles**, then choose **Create role**.
3. For **Trusted entity type**, choose **AWS service**.
4. Choose **CloudTrail** and click **Next**.
5. Attach the policy `AWSCloudTrailFullAccess` and click **Next**.
6. For **Role name**, enter a name for the role (e.g., `CloudTrail-CloudWatch-Role`).
7. Click **Create role**.

### 2.3 Attach the Role to CloudTrail
1. Return to the CloudTrail console.
2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Trails**.
3. Select the trail you created and choose **Edit**.
4. In the **CloudWatch Logs** section, choose **Enabled**.
5. For **CloudWatch log group**, select the log group you created (e.g., `CloudTrail/LogGroup`).
6. For **IAM role**, select the IAM role you created (e.g., `CloudTrail-CloudWatch-Role`).
7. Click **Save**.

## Step 3: Sending CloudWatch Logs to S3 (Optional)

### 3.1 Create an S3 Bucket for CloudWatch Logs (Optional)
If you want to archive CloudWatch Logs to S3, you need to create a separate S3 bucket for CloudWatch Logs.

### 3.2 Configure CloudWatch Logs to Export to S3
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [CloudWatch console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch).
2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Logs**, then select the log group you want to export.
3. Choose **Actions** -> **Export data to S3**.
4. Configure the following settings:
   - **Destination S3 bucket**: Select the bucket where you want to export logs.
   - **S3 prefix**: (Optional) Enter a prefix for log object keys in S3.
   - **IAM role**: Choose an existing IAM role that grants CloudWatch Logs permission to write to S3.
   - **Encryption**: (Optional) Choose the encryption settings for the exported data.
5. Click **Start export**.

### Example IAM Policy for IAM Role (for CloudWatch Logs to S3)
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetBucketAcl"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-cloudwatch-logs-bucket/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-cloudwatch-logs-bucket"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
- Replace `your-cloudwatch-logs-bucket` with your actual CloudWatch Logs S3 bucket name.

### 3.3 Verify Exported Logs in S3
After configuration, CloudWatch Logs will start exporting log data to the specified S3 bucket. You can verify this by checking the S3 bucket for exported log files.
